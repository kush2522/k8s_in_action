We need to deploy metric server first which is a pre-req for HPA

https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server (I referred this but there were lot of issues, I created my own file which you should use)

Run file one and wait for few seconds. You will see below commands start working:

kubectl top node
kubectl top pod

Run file two and wait for every thing to come up and then create autoscaler and do a stress testing:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set based on observed CPU utilization.

kubectl autoscale deployment webappsvc --cpu-percent=30 --min=1 --max=10

kubectl get hpa
